# Jewelry-Store-Home-Page

In this project I designed a home page for a jewelery store consisting of a navigation tab with 4 links and a body that consists of 2 sections, with the second section having 3 subsections. 

CSS pseudo classes were used to make the webpage interactive.

Through this project I practiced my advanced skill in HTML and CSS.
